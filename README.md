# Atrrition-rate

## What is Atrrition?
A common attrition rate definition refers to staff or employee turnover, but in a broader sense atrrition rate is a calculation of the number of individuals or items that vacate or move out of a larger, collective group that can be an organization over a specified time frame.

## Details of The Project
The project is divided into three parts :
    - Building a machine learning model to predict attrition among employees.
    - We build a web app on Django to mount the prediction model.
    - We deploy the Django project on Heroku through Github.
    
 ## Machine Learning Model
 We start of with building a machine learning model (we actually use 3 models and compare which is the best) and train that model using the attrition rate dataset having 900 datapoints.
